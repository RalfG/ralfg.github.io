Despite a high mortality rate and increasing antibiotic resistance no clinically approved vaccine against Listeria is available. Attenuated Listeria strains offer protection and are tested as antitumor vaccine vectors, but would benefit from a better knowledge on immunodominant vector antigens. To identify novel antigens, we screen for Listeria peptides presented on the surface of infected human cell lines by mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics. In between more than 15,000 human self-peptides, we detect 68 Listeria immunopeptides from 42 different bacterial proteins, including several known antigens. Peptides presented on different cell lines are often derived from the same bacterial surface proteins, classifying these antigens as potential vaccine candidates. Encoding these highly presented antigens in lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccine formulations results in specific CD8+ T-cell responses and induces protection in vaccination challenge experiments in mice. Our results can serve as a starting point for the development of a clinical mRNA vaccine against Listeria and aid to improve attenuated Listeria vaccines and vectors, demonstrating the power of immunopeptidomics for next-generation bacterial vaccine development.","tags":["immunopeptidomics","Listeria","proteomics","mass spectrometry"],"title":"Immunopeptidomics-based design of mRNA vaccine formulations against Listeria monocytogenes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arthur Declercq","Robbin Bouwmeester","Aurélie Degroeve","Hirschler","Christine Carapito","Sven","Lennart Martens","Ralf Gabriels"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660608e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660608e3,"objectID":"ee492a6848d2083946913cfed921b6de","permalink":"/publication/2022-ms2rescore-immunopeptidomics/","publishdate":"2022-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-ms2rescore-immunopeptidomics/","section":"publication","summary":"Immunopeptidomics aims to identify major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-presented peptides on almost all cells that can be used in anti-cancer vaccine development.

The full dissertation text is available at doi:10.5281/zenodo.6580035.\nAbstract Proteins are the molecular work horses of the cell and carry out many functional and structural tasks. In-depth knowledge of the complement of all proteins in a cell or tissue, called the proteome, can provide valuable insights into cellular biology in health and disease. To study the proteome in high throughput, liquid-chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is most-often the platform of choice. The result of an LC-MS/MS experiment is a large set of peptide spectra that require specific bioinformatics software to be identified. However, the confident identification of peptide spectra is not always straightforward, especially when novel challenging proteomics workflows are used. Examples of such workflows are data independent acquisition (DIA), proteogenomics, metaproteomics, biopeptidomics, and immunopeptidomics. Fortunately, machine learning (ML) can provide accurate predictions of peptide behavior in LC-MS/MS, allowing more LC-MS/MS data to be used in the identification process, resulting in a higher sensitivity. In this PhD research, the use of ML to enable novel proteomics workflows is investigated in-depth. First, the peptide spectrum predictor MS²PIP is significantly improved and extended to more use-cases. Second, a novel paradigm for the proteome-wide identification of DIA data is proposed and developed. Third, a perspective of the current state of peptide LC-MS/MS behavior predictors is given. Fourth, the MS²PIP spectrum predictor is integrated in a fully data-driven post-processing pipeline, which is subsequently applied on the various challenging proteomics workflows mentioned above. Fifth, preliminary results are shown on a novel modification-aware spectrum predictor. Each of the detailed applications of spectrum prediction for improved identification performance resulted in a more sensitive scoring function leading to more confident peptide identifications. In conclusion, ML proved to be a valuable tool for the identification of peptide mass spectra in challenging proteomics workflows. In the future, where proteomics experiments will become increasingly demanding, ML is expected to take up a central role in proteomics data analysis workflows.\n","date":1652918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652918400,"objectID":"a0e06cab3c99a12fbf516d5d6c11e069","permalink":"/talk/2022-public-phd-defense/","publishdate":"2022-05-19T12:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2022-public-phd-defense/","section":"talk","summary":"Introduction to proteomics, mass spectrometry, and machine learning for a layman audience and a summary of my PhD projects","tags":["Proteomics","Bioinformatics","Peptide identification","Data-independent Acquisition","Lecture"],"title":"Machine learning to the rescue: Enabling novel proteomics workflows with data-driven bioinformatics methods","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Xiyang Luo","Wout Bittremieux","Johannes Griss","Eric W.

Each such group of near-identical spectra can be represented by its so-called consensus spectrum for downstream processing. Although several algorithms for spectrum clustering have been adequately benchmarked and tested, the influence of the consensus spectrum generation step is rarely evaluated. Here, we present an implementation and benchmark of common consensus spectrum algorithms, including spectrum averaging, spectrum binning, the most similar spectrum, and the best-identified spectrum. We have analyzed diverse public data sets using two different clustering algorithms (spectra-cluster and MaRaCluster) to evaluate how the consensus spectrum generation procedure influences downstream peptide identification. The BEST and BIN methods were found the most reliable methods for consensus spectrum generation, including for data sets with post-translational modifications (PTM) such as phosphorylation.

This identification improvement is particularly useful for challenging proteomics experiments where conventional identification software often falls short. Notable examples of such cases are proteogenomics, data independent acquisition, and open modification searches. The latter also implicitly requires models that can account for residue modifications, but current state-of-the-art MS2 spectrum predictors cannot take these into account. Instead, the corresponding mass shift is introduced, and peak intensities are simply presumed to remain the same for modified and unmodified forms. We here therefore introduce a novel peptide spectrum predictor, called MS²DIP, which can provide accurate predictions for peptides carrying residue modifications, including for modifications not seen during training.\nImmunopeptidomics aims to identify immunopeptides, which are presented on major histocompatibility complexes. Existing mmunopeptidomics data analysis pipelines have some major hurdles to overcome, which complicates their identification.

Next to the classical bioactive peptides, emerging from larger precursor proteins by specific proteolytic processing, a new class of peptides originating from small open reading frames (sORFs) have been recognized as important biological regulators. But their intrinsic properties, specific expression pattern and location on presumed non-coding regions have hindered the full characterization of the repertoire of bioactive peptides, despite their predominant role in various pathways. Although the development of peptidomics has offered the opportunity to study these peptides in vivo, it remains challenging to identify the full peptidome as the lack of cleavage enzyme specification and large search space complicates conventional database search approaches. In this study, we introduce a proteogenomics methodology using a new type of mass spectrometry instrument and the implementation of machine learning tools toward improved identification of potential bioactive peptides in the mouse brain. The application of trapped ion mobility spectrometry (tims) coupled to a time-of-flight mass analyzer (TOF) offers improved sensitivity, an enhanced peptide coverage, reduction in chemical noise and the reduced occurrence of chimeric spectra. Subsequent machine learning tools MS2PIP, predicting fragment ion intensities and DeepLC, predicting retention times, improve the database searching based on a large and comprehensive custom database containing both sORFs and alternative ORFs. Finally, the identification of peptides is further enhanced by applying the post-processing semi-supervised learning tool Percolator. Applying this workflow, the first peptidomics workflow combined with spectral intensity and retention time predictions, we identified a total of 167 predicted sORF-encoded peptides, of which 48 originating from presumed non-coding locations, next to 401 peptides from known neuropeptide precursors, linked to 66 annotated bioactive neuropeptides from within 22 different families. Additional PEAKS analysis expanded the pool of SEPs on presumed non-coding locations to 84, while an additional 204 peptides completed the list of peptides from neuropeptide precursors. Altogether, this study provides insights into a new robust pipeline that fuses technological advancements from different fields ensuring an improved coverage of the neuropeptidome in the mouse brain.","tags":["MS²Rescore","MS²PIP","DeepLC","Proteomics","Mass spectrometry","sOFR peptides","bioactive peptides","peptidomics"],"title":"timsTOF analysis combined with fragment intensity predictions results in improved identification of classical bioactive peptides and sORF-encoded peptides","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ralf Gabriels"],"categories":null,"content":"Introduction to proteomics identification search engines:\n Overview of the LC-MS/MS DDA workflow The general inner workings of database search engines Other types: open-modification, tag-based, de novo, and spectral library searching  ","date":1631577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631577600,"objectID":"d87e0762b8d189b08397a25ef71ad12b","permalink":"/talk/2021-protrein-summer-school/","publishdate":"2021-09-15T13:50:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2021-protrein-summer-school/","section":"talk","summary":"Lecture: Introduction to proteomics identification search engines","tags":["Proteomics","Bioinformatics","Search engines","Lecture"],"title":"Algorithms for automatic spectrum identification","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eric W.

The policy response to such pandemics will always have to include accurate monitoring of the spread, as this provides one of the few alternatives to total lockdown. However, COVID-19 diagnosis is currently performed almost exclusively by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Although this is efficient, automatable, and acceptably cheap, reliance on one type of technology comes with serious caveats, as illustrated by recurring reagent and test shortages. We therefore developed an alternative diagnostic test that detects proteolytically digested SARS-CoV-2 proteins using mass spectrometry (MS). We established the Cov-MS consortium, consisting of 15 academic laboratories and several industrial partners to increase applicability, accessibility, sensitivity, and robustness of this kind of SARS-CoV-2 detection. This, in turn, gave rise to the Cov-MS Digital Incubator that allows other laboratories to join the effort, navigate, and share their optimizations and translate the assay into their clinic. As this test relies on viral proteins instead of RNA, it provides an orthogonal and complementary approach to RT-PCR using other reagents that are relatively inexpensive and widely available, as well as orthogonally skilled personnel and different instruments.

These workflows are all challenging because of ambiguity in the identification stage; they either expand the search space and thus increase the ambiguity of identifications, or, in the case of DIA, they generate data that is inherently more ambiguous. In this context, machine learning-based predictive models are now generating considerable excitement in the field of proteomics because these predictive models hold great potential to drastically reduce the ambiguity in the identification process of the above-mentioned workflows. Indeed, the field has already produced classical machine learning and deep learning models to predict almost every aspect of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiment. Yet despite all the excitement, thorough integration of predictive models in these challenging LC-MS workflows is still limited, and further improvements to the modeling and validation procedures can still be made. In this viewpoint we therefore point out highly promising recent machine learning developments in proteomics, alongside some of the remaining challenges.","tags":["Machine Learning","Deep Learning","Data-Driven Modeling","Proteomics","Mass Spectrometry"],"title":"The Age of Data-Driven Proteomics: How Machine Learning Enables Novel Workflows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bart Van Puyvelde","Sander Willems","Ralf Gabriels","Simon Daled","Laura De Clerck","Sofie Vande Casteele","An Staes","Francis Impens","Dieter Deforce","Lennart Martens","Sven Degroeve","Maarten Dhaenens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580860800,"objectID":"25c6ee9e79935274a93d1ad84438f156","permalink":"/publication/2020-ms2pip-dia/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T18:40:09.747487Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-ms2pip-dia/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Data-independent acquisition (DIA) generates comprehensive yet complex mass spectrometric data, which imposes the use of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) libraries for deep peptide-centric detection.

The knowledge embedded in these datasets can be used to improve peptide identification workflows. Spectral library searching provides a straightforward method to boost identification rates using previously identified spectra. Alternatively, machine learning methods can learn from these spectra to accurately predict the behavior of peptides in a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system.  At the basis of both approaches are spectral libraries: Unified collections of previously identified spectra. Organizations and projects such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Global Proteome Machine, PeptideAtlas, PRIDE Archive and MassIVE have all compiled spectral libraries for a multitude of species and experimental setups. A large obstacle, however, is that each organization provides libraries in a different file format. At the software level the problem propagates (if not expands), as different software tools require different file formats.  The solution is a standardized spectral library format that is sufficiently flexible to meet all users' demands, but that is also standardized enough to be usable across environments and software packages. This balance is achieved by setting up a standardized framework and a controlled vocabulary with metadata terms, and allow the format to be represented in different forms, such as plain text, JSON and HDF.  So far, the required (and optional) meta data has been compiled and added to the PSI-MS ontology, and versions of the text and JSON representations have been drafted. The tabular and HDF representations of the format are in development, as well as converters and validators in various programming languages.","tags":["HUPO-PSI","Proteomics","Standards","Spectral libraries","Mass Spectrometry","Computational Proteomics","Bioinformatics","Ontology","GitHub","PSI-MS","HDF","JSON","EuBIC"],"title":"The HUPO-PSI standardized spectral library format","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ralf Gabriels","Lennart Martens","Sven Degroeve"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563408e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563408e3,"objectID":"326c40a555975014faf2f49a62624c19","permalink":"/talk/2019-bepa-mini-symposium/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T15:50:28+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-bepa-mini-symposium/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["MS²PIP","Proteomics","Machine Learning","Bioinformatics"],"title":"MS²PIP: Predicting peptide spectrum peak intensities to improve proteomics identification","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ralf Gabriels","Lennart Martens","Sven Degroeve"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"1058f1acf04e6fc4a300cd80f9a2dad1","permalink":"/publication/2019-asms/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T11:34:26.299121Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-asms/","section":"publication","summary":"An important step in high-throughput mass spectrometry-based proteomics is the correct identification of peptide MS² fragmentation spectra. Due to incomplete understanding of the fragmentation process and unpredictable machine noise, matching MS² spectra with the correct peptide is far from trivial. We therefore developed, in 2013, MS²PIP: MS² Peak Intensity Prediction, a data-driven tool that accurately predicts the expected MS² spectrum for a given peptide. Nevertheless, specific fragmentation techniques, instruments and isobaric labels influence the peak intensities in such a way, that the general MS²PIP models underperform when predicting for these special cases. Because MS²PIP is a purely data-driven approach, we can make use of the vast quantities of publicly available proteomics data and train specific MS²PIP models on relevant datasets.\n\nTo train and evaluate specific MS²PIP models for CID and HCD fragmentation, for TripleTOF 5600+ instruments and for TMT and iTRAQ-labeled peptides, we downloaded and parsed a multitude of publicly available spectral libraries and experimental datasets. The size of the train-test datasets ranged from 129 000 to 1.6 million unique peptide spectra. We can evaluate the models’ performance by predicting MS² spectra present in the external evaluation datasets and comparing these predictions to their corresponding empirical spectra. This comparison is done by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient of the two spectra, each normalized to their total-ion-current.\n\nThe median Pearson correlations are consistently and substantially higher when we apply the specific models to the corresponding specific evaluation dataset (e.g. TMT model to TMT dataset), then when we apply the specific models to mismatched evaluation datasets (e.g. TMT model to CID dataset). This confirms that there are indeed strong differences in fragmentation pattern between the specific cases, and emphasizes the need for specific MS²PIP models.\n\nPredictions from the specific models yield median Pearson correlations higher then 0.90, except for the TripleTOF 5600+ and the iTRAQ phospho models, which have median Pearson correlations of 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. It is also noteworthy that models for labeling techniques perform similarly on all datasets, indicating that TMT and iTRAQ labels affect the fragmentation pattern in a comparable fashion.\n\nMS²PIP has already been used for creating proteome-wide spectral libraries for search engines (including Data Independent Acquisition), for selecting discriminative transitions for targeted proteomics and for validating interesting peptide identifications (e.g. biomarkers). These new models extend the applicability of MS²PIP even further, allowing it to be applied when specific fragmentation methods, instruments, or labeling techniques are employed.\n\nAll MS²PIP models are available on the user-friendly MS²PIP web server (https://iomics.ugent.be/ms2pip). Users can upload up to 100.000 peptide sequences simultaneously, for which MS²PIP predicts MS² spectra in just a few seconds. The resulting spectra can be inspected through interactive plots and can be downloaded in both CSV and MGF file formats.\n\nWith these specific models, MS²PIP is the first MS² peak intensity predictor for specific instruments, fragmentation methods and labeling techniques.","tags":["MS²PIP","Proteomics","Machine Learning","Bioinformatics"],"title":"MS²PIP : fast and accurate MS² peak intensity prediction for multiple fragmentation methods, instruments and labeling techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ralf Gabriels","Lennart Martens","Sven Degroeve"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"209b5a6f85cbb0ade397b163eb30166c","permalink":"/publication/2019-ms2pip/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T11:34:26.269404Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-ms2pip/","section":"publication","summary":"MS²PIP is a data-driven tool that accurately predicts peak intensities for a given peptide's fragmentation mass spectrum.
