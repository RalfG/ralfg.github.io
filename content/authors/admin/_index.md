Dr. Ralf Gabriels completed his PhD in Life Sciences at Ghent University in May 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Sven Degroeve and Prof. Lennart Martens, and commenced his [FWO Junior Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.fwo.be/en/support-programmes/all-calls/postdoctoral-researchers/junior-postdoctoral-fellowship/) in October 2022. His work applies machine learning to proteomics, particularly peptide fragmentation, to enhance identification sensitivity and specificity.

From October 2025, as an [FWO Senior Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.fwo.be/en/support-programmes/all-calls/postdoctoral-researchers/senior-postdoctoral-fellowship/), he will develop graph neural network and large‐language‐model frameworks for the prediction and interpretation of post‐translational modifications, integrating these advances with investigations of ageing‐related proteome changes.

An active proponent of open science, Ralf serves as elected representative of the European Bioinformatics Community for Mass Spectrometry ([EuBIC‐MS](https://eubic-ms.org/)), co-organizes EuBIC‐MS conferences and contributes to EuBIC-MS projects such as [Rusteomics](https://github.com/rusteomics). He co‐chairs the newly formed HUPO‐PSI AI Readiness working group, contributes to [HUPO‐PSI](https://www.psidev.info/) data standards (mzSpecLib, ProForma 2.0, Universal Spectrum Identifier), co‐leads [ProteomicsML](https://proteomicsml.org/)—an educational platform for machine learning in proteomics—and regularly co‐hosts workshops, Bioinformatics Hub sessions, and delivers educational lectures.
